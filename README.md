and green bricks are falling from random positions at the
far (top) end. You have a laser cannon that can shoot a
short laser ray in the direction pointed by the cannon (see
Figure 1). You can move the canon up & down on vertical
axis and also control it’s tilt. The game should display the final score when it gets over.

game as per your liking. It is your game.

1. Mirror Reflection: Laser rays’s follow the standard
optics for their reflection behavior.
2. Laser Firing Rate: Once you shoot a laser ray, the
canon takes one second to recharge, and then only
you can shoot again.
3. On World Boundary: Laser rays are absorbed by the
boundary wall of the 2D world.


You should be able to tilt the canon upward and down-
ward using the keys (a and d) and move it up and down
using the keys (s and f). Use the keys (n and m) to in-
crease or decrease the speed of bricks falling (within the
permissible limits). Left and right movement of baskets
can be controlled with Ctr+left and Ctr+right (for the red
basket) and Alt+left and Alt+right (for the blue basket).
The left/right arrow keys should be used to pan the scene
and the up/down keys to zoom in and out respectively.
One should be able to shoot with the space bar.


One should also have mouse controls to achieve the
above. You should also be able to select any movable
object by clicking on or near it (highlight the selected ob-
ject). Then you can move baskets left or right and canon
up and down by dragging. Use the position where you
click to decide the direction of the shot. Use the mouse
scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Use the right mouse but-
ton to pan left/right when you click and drag.
